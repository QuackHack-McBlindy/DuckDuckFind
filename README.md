## **Getting Started**

To get started with DuckDuckFind, follow these steps:

### **1. Clone the Repository:**

   Clone the DuckDuckFind repository to your local machine and navigate into it.

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/QuackHack-McBlindy/duckduckfind.git
  cd DuckDuckFind
  ```

### **2. Build and Run the Project Using Docker:**

   Use Docker to build and run DuckDuckFind.

  ```
  docker compose up -d --build
  ```

This will set up and run DuckDuckFind in the background.<br>
http://localhost:5111/ ready to handle your queries.

### **3. Settings:**

   http://localhost:5556/settings <br>
   Go see settings. <br>
   To achieve the best results, you should try to control the scoring system by adjusting the settings.  <br>
   Specifically:

    1. Add words to the Important Phrases list.
    2. Adjust the Minimal Score Threshold.

For each word in your query that matches a word in the search result, the result earns +1 score. If the word also appears in the Important Phrases, it earns an additional +1 score.

Understanding and controlling the score system as much as possible can sometimes be crucial, and the difference between the best result and a *zero* result.<br>


## **Example Usage**

   *just start qwackin',*   
   *ducks should handle the rest.*

  ```
  curl -X POST http://localhost:5556/ -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query": "User Qwack Here"}'
