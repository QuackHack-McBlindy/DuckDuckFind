### **3. Settings:**

   http://localhost:5556/settings <br>
   Go see settings. <br>
   To achieve the best results, you should try to control the scoring system by adjusting the settings.  <br>
   Specifically:

    1. Add words to the Important Phrases list.
    2. Adjust the Minimal Score Threshold.

For each word in your query that matches a word in the search result, the result earns +1 score. If the word also appears in the Important Phrases, it earns an additional +1 score.

Understanding and controlling the score system as much as possible can sometimes be crucial, and the difference between the best result and a *zero* result.<br>
